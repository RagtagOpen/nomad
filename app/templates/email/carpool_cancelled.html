<p>Hello {{ person.name }},</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the carpool from {{ carpool.from_place }} to {{ carpool.destination.name }} at {{ carpool.leave_time | humanize }} has been cancelled.</p>

<p>The driver gave the following reason for cancelling: {{ reason }}.</p>

<p>You can ask them at {{ driver.email }} or {{ driver.phone_number }} ({{ driver.preferred_contact_method }} preferred) if they're willing to reschedule, or go to {{ url_for('carpool.find', _external=True) }} to look for another ride.</p>

<p>Thank you for your enthusiasm!</p>
